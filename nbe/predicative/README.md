# Normalization by Evaluation (NbE)

We approach DOT from the perspective of predicative (Martin-LÃ¶f) type theory.
This is ~~work in progress~~ currently inactive, because we desire a version
with impredicative polymorphism.

* Model abstract types as forms of Sigma types/existentials.
* Combine predicative universe hierarchy, cumulativity, and subtyping with top types.
