# Normalization by Evaluation (NbE)

Metatheory of NbE DOT/System D calculi with richer forms of dependent types.
We investigate strong normalization and logical consistency. 

Go beyond Scala/DOT. Generalize from path-dependent to full dependent types.
  * Path expressions become just a special case of full dependent types.
  * NbE for deciding equality.

## Contents
* 'impredicative/' : NbE for an impredicative System D variant in Coq.
* 'predicative/' : NbE for an predicative System D variant in Agda. Currently abandoned.
* 'scala/' : Scala implementation of NbE and bidirectional type checking.
