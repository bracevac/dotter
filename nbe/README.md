# Normalization by Evaluation (NbE)

We approach DOT from the perspective of predicative (Martin-LÃ¶f) type theory.
This is work in progress.

* Go beyond Scala/DOT. Generalize from path-dependent to full dependent types.
  * Path expressions become just a special case of full dependent types.
  * NbE for deciding equality.
* Model abstract types as forms of Sigma types/existentials.
* Combine predicative universe hierarchy, cumulativity, and subtyping with top types.
* Normalization by evaluation and its metatheory, following techniques by Andreas Abel.
* Agda formalization in the `agda/` folder. Currently working on completeness and strong normalization.
* Scala implementation in the `scala/` folder.
